#  Deep Research Agentic System

A fully agentic AI-powered research assistant that autonomously collects information, synthesizes it, and drafts high-quality research reports based on a given topic. It leverages LangGraph for stateful agent orchestration, Tavily for web search, and Gemini Pro for content generation â€” all wrapped in a Streamlit UI with PDF export.

##  Features

-  **Research Agent**: Gathers factual insights from the web using Tavily Search API.
-  **Writer Agent**: Drafts a well-structured, coherent research report using Gemini Pro (Google's LLM).
-  **Cyclic Graph-based Agent Execution**: Powered by LangGraph for memory/state persistence.
-  **Streamlit Frontend**: Clean, user-friendly UI for interaction.
-  **PDF Report Generation**: Download the final report as a beautifully formatted PDF.
